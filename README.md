# DecoyCards
Scambaiting tool thingie by Baitrix

Generate fake gift card codes to waste scammers' time. These codes look real but are completely fake and worthless.

This would have been a website if I had the money to host one lmao

**WARNING: These are FAKE codes only for scambaiting. Never try to redeem them on real websites.**

## Easy Setup

1. Download this as a ZIP file and extract it
2. Double-click `setup.bat` (Windows) or run `setup.sh` (Mac/Linux)  
3. Double-click `start_gui.bat` for the easy interface OR `start_cli.bat` for the menu version

## What This Thing Does

Makes fake gift card codes that look real but don't work. Perfect for wasting scammers' time when they ask for gift cards.

### Gift Card Types
- Xbox Live, PlayStation, Amazon, Google Play, Apple/iTunes, Steam, Walmart, Target, Visa
- Codes look exactly like real ones but are completely fake
- Pick how many you want (CLI asks you, GUI has a number box)
- Copy codes easily with one click in the GUI

### Store Timer (The Good Stuff)
This pretends you're going to the store to buy gift cards - super useful for phone scambaiting:
- Enter how far the store is OR just put in your own time
- Timer counts down for "going to store" then "coming back home" 
- Makes sounds and pops up when timer finishes
- Can generate gift cards right when you "reach" the store

### Command Line Way
